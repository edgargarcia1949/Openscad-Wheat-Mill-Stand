# Openscad-Wheat-Mill-Stand
Openscad Wheat Mill Stand drawing with exploded view and Openscad script files

I have created an Openscad script which draws a mill stand with adjustable width, depth and height.
The dimensions and material required are echoed in the Openscad output which displays on the terminal
screen.
The dimensions are English inches but can be converted to centimeters by multiplying 2.54 to every dimension.
I have made one of these for my wife and it came out pretty nice.
